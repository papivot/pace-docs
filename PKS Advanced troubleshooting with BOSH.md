# PKS Advanced Troubleshooting with BOSH

Besides the normal troubleshooting that can be performed using the Opsman UI and the kubectl commands, there are numerous troubleshooting processes that can be performed through the BOSH CLI. 

*Note: A number of these are advanced troubleshooting operations and should only be performed by experienced customers with the help of Pivotal Support.*  

### Requirements 
- Access to Pivotal Ops Manager UI with PKS tile deployed
- SSH Access to Pivotal Ops Manager
- A K8s cluster deployed in PKS


### Login to BOSH Director

The best and the easiest way to login to the BOSH director is to login via the Ops Manager.  To complete the process -

 -  Navigate to the Pivotal Ops Manager FQDN in your browser.
 - Log in.
 - Click on the Pivotal Director Tile (vSphere). 
 - Click the tab labeled  `status`. You will find the list of VMs deployed by the platform and their current status here.
 - Note the IP of the  `Ops Manager Director`  job down: this is the Director. The director has the knowledge of all kubernetes clusters deployed.
 - Click the tab labeled  `credentials`. You will find the Pivotal Director credentials that the platform auto generates when deploying tiles here.
 - Click  `Link to Credential`  under Director Credentials.
 - Write the  `identity` and  `password`  down. This is the username and password we will use to connect to the Director.
 - Use SSH and the password set when deploying Pivotal Ops Manager, SSH to the Ops Manager VM. You can SSH into the Ops Manager machine using your favorite IaaS supported method. 
 
 > `ssh ubuntu@<PIVOTAL-OPS-MANAGER-FQDN`

In this example, you can use the `gcloud` command and authentication to SSH to your Ops Manager VM.

> `gcloud compute --project "[projectname]" ssh --zone "us-east1-c" "[opsman_vm_instance_name]"`

- Use the `bosh` cli to connect to the Director using the IP found earlier.
> `bosh alias-env pcf -e <DIRECTOR-IP> --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate`

- Login to the `bosh` cli using the username, and password found earlier.
>`bosh -e pcf login`

- An output similar to this indicates a successful login 
```shell
Using environment '10.0.0.5'
 
Email (): director
Password ():

Successfully authenticated with UAA

Succeeded
```

### Viewing BOSH deployments 

BOSH deploys our PKS clusters. Let us list those deployments.

>`bosh -e pcf deployments`

This should return something similar to this - 
```shell

```

-   Notice the  `Pivotal-container-service`  deployment which was deployed from the PKS tile. Also notice the  `service-instance_*`  which is our deployed PKS cluster, note it down.

Most of the commands, while troubleshooting, would need to reference the `service-instance-*` deployment. 

### SSH into K8s node VMs

Using the service-instance value in the previous command, you can execute the following command to list all the VMs associated with that particular deployment. 
>`bosh -e pcf -d service-instance_47267983-9989-41ce-bc33-905e249b1fbc vms`

This should return an output similar to this - 

```shell
sing environment '10.0.0.5' as user 'director'

Congratulations !!! You have logged into a BOSH deployed K8s node.

### SCP files into K8s VMs

At times you may need to transfer some files to the K8s nodes that are managed by BOSH. This can be achieved similar to the BOSH CLI ssh command. Execute the following command to copy a file [.bash_history] to the /tmp folder in one of the master nodes. 

> `bosh -e pcf -d service-instance_47267983-9989-41ce-bc33-905e249b1fbc scp .bash_history master/38ed427f-2998-4de0-8906-50e0accb8ae1:/tmp`

```shell

Once successfully completed, login and validate that the .bash_history file exist in /tmp of the master VM.

The output also lists successes, errors and cancellations. This is very helpful for troubleshooting. 

 - To view what actions were preformed for a specific task, execute the following (in this example 311 is the task_ID that we need more information on)

>`bosh -e pcf -d service-instance_47267983-9989-41ce-bc33-905e249b1fbc task -a 311`

This should return details on that task ID -

To view details of an event, execute the event command with the event_id as a parameter. 

> `bosh -e pcf -d service-instance_47267983-9989-41ce-bc33-905e249b1fbc event 4180`

should retune something similar to this - 

```shell
Using environment '10.0.0.5' as user 'director'

#### Logs

- To fetch logs from **all** the VMs associated with the deployment, execute the following - 
> `bosh -e pcf -d service-instance_47267983-9989-41ce-bc33-905e249b1fbc logs`

This should return something similar to this output  - 
```shell

### Deleting a cluster deployment 

While all cluster deployments have to be created and managed using the PKS CLI, it may happen at times that there is a failure during the creation of K8S clusters using the PKS CLI. This can happen for multiple reasons (outside the scope of this excecise) but may leave the deployment in a a funky state. PKS CLI may not be able to delete the cluster using `pks delete-cluster [cluster_name]` command. 

To delete such a deployment, you can leverage the BOSH CLI to clean up, similar to this example -

> `bosh -e pcf -d service-instance_47267983-9989-41ce-bc33-905e249b1fbc delete-deployment`

Once done, clean up the reference in PKS database by execute 

> `pks delete-cluster [cluster_name]`
