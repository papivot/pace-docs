# PKS Workload Deployment using Helm

In this lab/demo, we will show you how to deploy a set of applications using Helm on a K8s cluster. This exercise serves multiple purposes - 

1. How to interact with Helm to deploy applications
2. Since the choice of application is Prometheus and Grafana, it will also show how to start with monitoring and reporting on a K8s cluster
3. Show how to interact with an application running on K8s cluster. 

### Requirements 
- A working K8s cluster with admin access. (*Pivotal employees connected thru the VPN can request a PKS environment in GCP thru [Toolsmith](https://environments.toolsmiths.cf-app.com/home). Upon a PKS environment has been created, you can login using the pks cli and create a cluster using an active plan.)*
